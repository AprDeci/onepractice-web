A tipping point was reached in 2020 when human-made materials—such as steel, concrete and plastic—were found to weigh more than all life on Earth. Continuing to grow concrete forests rather than real ones is shortsighted. Simply being in the nearest wood has such health benefits that the Woodland Trust successfully lobbied for it to be prescribed by doctors.\n\nYet slipping from popular culture is the wonder and beauty of the natural world. For every three nature-related words in hit songs of the 1950s, researchers found, there was only slightly more than one 50 years later. It is not a moment too soon that teenagers will be able to take a natural history test, given that for decades children have been able to name more video game characters than wildlife species.\n\nPart of remedying this social disease would be for parliament to pass a \"right to grow\" law, allowing anyone to turn underused public spaces into vegetable and fruit gardens. The idea is for people to get back in touch with the soil—while producing food sustainably.\n\nVegetable planting has a respectable tradition. In April 1649, locals responded to high prices and food shortages by cultivating vegetables on common land in Southern England. The practice of throwing seed bombs to turn vacant plots of land green took off in 1970s New York, and has been revived (使复活) by green-thumbed (有园艺才能的) social media influencers who defy local US regulations in a war on ugly spots in cities.\n\nApart from the urgent task of providing more healthy nutrients to those who increasingly can''t afford them, publicly accessible fruit and vegetable gardens connect what we eat to where it comes from—the means of production, if you will. They can make unlovely spaces lovely, and marry use and beauty as well as help promote a sense of community. Plants are also, of course, our first defence against species loss and climate change.

Young women engineers are more accepted mostly because there are just more of them.\n\nMany women engineers hailed the benefits of their chosen career.

The quest to attain this mysterious state has dominated discussion around careers for years—especially for working parents. The concept is often presented as something to achieve, or a goal to reach.

Some researchers are now encouraging us to stop thinking about work-life balance as an achievement that you either hit or don''t.

Fourth, they considered their alternatives: is there anything at work that could be changed to accommodate these new priorities?

It''s not simply about dividing up the hours in your day between work, the gym, kids and chores.

What we call \\\"work-life balance\\\" is actually just a substitute to having a sense of fulfillment and contentment.\",\n        \"I\": \"Of course, finding that balance probably shouldn''t be something you have to do by yourself. Research by Erin Kelly, professor of work and organisation studies at MIT, shows companies and managers can play a key role in creating a better environment for workers. For her book Overload: How Good Jobs Went Bad and What to Do about It, she and co-author Phyllis Moen split more than 1,000 employees at a Fortune 500 company into two groups, one that worked under a management redesign and one that continued working within the existing management structure.\",\n        \"J\": \"Under the management redesign, many steps were taken to ensure better work-life balance and prevent burnout (精疲力竭). Managers were regularly reminded to explicitly support their employees. Workers were allowed to make changes, like cancelling 9 am meetings. All of this was done in the name of increasing job satisfaction and giving workers greater flexibility, and to assure workers that it was something management was committed to. Unsurprisingly, Kelly and Moen found that employees in the redesign group reported less stress and less burnout. They were less likely to quit their jobs; indeed, over the next four years, they were 40% less likely to quit than those who kept working under the old policies.\",\n        \"K\": \"\\\"Work-life balance is understood to be an individual''s response, so people think ''it''s up to me to manage the craziness of my work life\\\", says Kelly. But organisations need to examine the demands they''re placing on employees. \\\"The root problem is not how the two pieces of work and life come together. It''s that we have unrealistic expectations of what we''re asked to do on the work side.\\\" If your workplace isn''t an environment where work-life balance is possible in the first place, any effort you attempt to make toward it on a personal level will be in vain.\",\n        \"L\": \"That''s a conversation that appears to be gathering pace. The new prevalence of remote and flexible working models will likely all play important roles in how we balance our professional and personal lives. And if it seems like finding that perfect balance remains difficult to achieve, the experts say that keeping some perspective can help. For millions of people, work is about being able to put food on the table.
