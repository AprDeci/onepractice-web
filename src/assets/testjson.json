    "paragraphs": {
        "A": "Certain institutions,such as schools,are likely to close when bad weather,such as snow,flooding or extreme heat or cold,causes travel difficulties,power outages(断供),or otherwise endangers public safety.When snowy weather arrives in the US,it means the chance of school children benefiting from the long-standing tradition of the \"snow day\",when schools are forced to close and students get an unexpected day off.",
        "B": "The criterion for a snow day is primarily the inability of school buses to operate safely on their routes and danger to children who walk to school.Often,the school remains officially open even though buses do not run and classes are canceled.Severe weather that causes cancellation or delayis more likely in regions that are less able to handle the situation.Snow days are less common in more northern areas of the United States that are used to heavy winter snowfall,because municipalities are well equipped to clear roads and remove snow.In areas less accustomed to snow even small snowfalls of an inch ortwo may render roads unsafe.",
        "C": "Snow days are a familiar theme in American film and TV shows,with children getting the good news and then running outside for some seasonal snowman-building and snowball throwing,against a background of joyful pop music.But the tradition is now over for pupils in several US states such as South Carolina, Nevada,Georgia and Indiana.This academic year,many school boards have introduced policies which require students to work from home if the school is shut by snow or extreme weather.They are known as \"e-learning days\",which certainly sounds less fun than a snow day.",
        "D": "Teachers are also losing their snow days and instead will be expected to be on hand to take a virtual register and answer students' questions online.A pilot programme in a school district in Anderson County,South Carolina,has supplied students with electronic tablets loaded with assignments to complete in the event of a school closure.If it is successful,it could be rolled out across the state.",
        "E": "But some parents object to the new policy if the vigorous debate on the Facebook page of Anderson County school district is anything to go by.\"When it snows,let the kids enjoy it,\"said one commenter.Another said the decision would \"ruin school even more\",and someone else called snow days\"a fun part of childhood\". But supporters of the policy say it means children will miss fewer days of school.It will also bring to an end  a less popular US high school tradition:the \"make-up day\",which requires students in many states to make up the time lost due to weatherby working during school holidays.",
        "F": "Students in North Carolina already have several make-up days scheduled because of school closures during Hurricane   Florence,which    struck   in    September.Tom    Wilson,the    superintendent(主管)of  Anderson County school district,said the change away from snow days makes practical and financial sense.He said technology  has  changed  every  profession,so  it  makes  sense  to  use  it to\"eliminate\"make-up  days.Adam Baker  of the  Department  of  Education  in  Indiana  said  e-learning  days  were  proving  a\"great  success\". He  said  most  Indiana  schools  already  use  digital  devices  during  lessons,so  it  was  an\"easy  decision\"to extend this to days when schools are closed.He denies the decision is depriving children of the chance to enjoy the snow.\"Students are still able to enjoy snow days and outside time,\"he said.\"Many have PE and science assignments that have them out enjoying the weather.\"But local school superintendents in Ohio are resisting proposals to adopt e-learning days.They fear that students without internet access at home will be disadvantaged by the policy,and superintendent Tom Roth is concerned that e-learning days will offer a lower quality of education.",
        "G": "There are also so-called\"blizzard bags\",with assignments that children take home ahead of an expected snow closure.But Mr Roth says it is not sufficient as a replacement.\"I think we still need the class time to give our kids the education that they deserve,\"he said.\"Youcan't get that with a blizzard bag or doing the work from home like that.It's not going to be as effective.\"",
        "H": "There is a long-running debate on whether missing days of school affects attainment.In England,there has been a focus on tackling absenteeism(旷课)from  school.The  Department  for  Education(DFE)published research in 2016 arguing that missing any days at school could have a negative impact on results.Even a few days lost in a year could be enough to miss out on getting a good exam grade,the DFE's research concluded. This differed from the findings of a study from Harvard University in the US,which concluded that missing a few occasional days because of the weather did not damage learning.",
        "I": "The Harvard study examined seven years of school results data and could not find any impact from snow closures.What  caused  moredisruption  was  when  schools  tried  to  stay  open  in  bad  weather,even  though many staff and pupils were absent.But weather can make a difference to school results,according to another piece of Harvard research published last summer.It's hot weather that has the negative impact.The results of 10 million school students were examined over 13 years and researchers found a\"significant\"link between  years with extremely hotweather and lower results.",
        "J": "It's obvious that students should go to school every day to get the most out of education.In cases of extreme weather  students  don't  always  have  that  option.However,research  shows  that  authorised  absences  from school such as during extreme weather are less problematic for students than absences that are not authorised. This is because unauthorised absences tend to reflect patterns and behaviours of student disengagement,or the possible negative attitudes of parents towards education that students adopt and carry with them through schooling.The level of impact on students'educational performance is all to do with the length of time that a student is absent from school and how regularly this occurs."
